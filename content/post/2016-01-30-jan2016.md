## keep

* coding every day
* start with tiny example
* RTFM aka "read the xxxx manual", read api doc

## problem

* not enough time!
* otemachi building is like a maze.. don't waste time.

## try

* building "real" micro service
* stay streaking with github

```
have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. 
they somehow already know what you truly want to become.
